# Tweet Analyzer

# Overview
The purpose of this example is to demonstrate how to write a real world use case using kafka. This is a tweet analyzer application implemented using the APIs provided by the packages HTTP and Kafka. 

The twitter client is being written using a ballerina HTTP client. This example can be used as a starting point to write a Twitter client to call to Twitter developer APIs. To make it easier to try out we have used a mock twitter server, written using an HTTP service.  

Both Kafka producer, and consumer APIs are being used in this example.
