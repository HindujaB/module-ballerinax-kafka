# Order Manager

## Overview
This usecase is inspired by the [How Kafka Can Make Microservice Planet a Better Place](https://dzone.com/articles/how-kafka-can-make-microservice-planet-better) article.
This consists of 3 services.

- **Order Service** - An Http service with a Kafka producer which publishes an order to a Kafka topic when a request is received.
- **Order Processor** - A Kafka listener which listens to the Kafka topic and validates the order. If the order is successful, it is published to a new topic by a Kafka producer.
- **Notification Service** - A Kafka listener which listens to the successful orders and mocks sending a notification.

## Implementation
